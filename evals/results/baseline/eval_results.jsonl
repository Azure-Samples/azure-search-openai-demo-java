When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.\nUnder Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.\nIn-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=7: It is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill you after the health plan pays them.\nWhen selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.\nFinally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service. Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.\nBalance Billing Protection\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS - Balance Billing Protection\nAt Contoso, we understand that medical costs can be intimidating and confusing, which is why we've partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees the Northwind Standard plan. This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers.\nWhat is balance billing?\nBalance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance billing when visiting in-network providers.\nWhat is an in-network provider?\nIn-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan's payment terms. Visiting an in-network provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network providers on the Northwind Health website.\nWhat if I visit an out-of-network provider?\nVisiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing. Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in- network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.\nTips to avoid balance billing:\n· Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=6: There are a few tips you can follow to ensure you are taking full advantage of continuity of care and are getting the best, most affordable care possible.

Participating providers are those who have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan's set rates. Non- participating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can charge the patient more than what the health plan pays.\nWhen you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider's actual charges and the amount the plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your provider's policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to discuss this with your provider prior to receiving services.\nAdditionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of- pocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider. For example, if your provider's charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the remaining $100 balance billing amount.\nExceptions\nThere are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating providers.

However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind Standard network will not be covered by the plan.\nWhen you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.\nWhen you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about the other coverage you have.

This means that Northwind Standard will pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.\nThe primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your healthcare costs.\nFor example, if you have a spouse's health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse's plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This means that your spouse's plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.\nIt's important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75: that exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000 deductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from the primary plan will be paid.\nThere are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D will be the secondary coverage.\nIt's also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as \"creditable coverage,\" and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses once the primary plan has paid.\nWhen it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it's important to remember that each health plan is different. Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage.\nFinally, if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, be sure to reach out to Northwind Health. Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage.\nCOB's Effect On Benefits\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?\nWhen you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical expenses. The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the company that pays second is called the secondary payer.\nCoordination of Benefits Exceptions\nThere are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans' health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind Standard may pay first.\nUnderstanding How COB Affects Your Benefits\nWhen COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost.

A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.\nHowever, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally, prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per individual and $500 per family.\nIt is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.\nTips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible\nMeeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.\nFirst, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%.

The Northwind Standard plan has a large network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are not paying more than you have to for services.\nThird, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs.\nFinally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket.\nBy following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.\nCoinsurance\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible.

Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can seek reimbursement from another insurance company if you have secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northwind Health Plus and another insurance provider, Northwind Health Plus may be able to recoup the costs of medical services they paid for from the other insurance company.\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can reimburse you for certain medical expenses that you paid for out-of-pocket. This is beneficial if you received medical services that were not covered by Northwind Health Plus.\nWhen it comes to subrogation and reimbursement, it is important to note that Northwind Health Plus reserves the right to subrogate and reimburse any payments made for medical services. This includes payments made directly by you and other insurance companies. In the event that Northwind Health Plus is able to subrogate or reimburse payments, you will be notified of this before any funds are exchanged.\nWhen it comes to subrogation, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus will only seek reimbursement from another insurer if your primary insurance coverage does not cover the services that you received. This means that if your primary insurance covers the services that you received, Northwind Health Plus will not seek reimbursement.\nWhen it comes to reimbursement, there are certain exceptions to Northwind Health Plus's policy. For example, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services that were covered by another insurance provider. Additionally, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services that you received from an out-of-network provider, unless the service was deemed medically necessary and was not available from an in-network provider.\nFinally, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus may require that you submit certain documentation in order to receive reimbursement. This documentation may include itemized bills, proof of payment, and/or medical records.\nIn order to ensure that you are able to take full advantage of Northwind Health Plus's subrogation and reimbursement policy, it is important to keep detailed records of all medical services that you receive. This includes records of payments made by you, other insurance companies, and Northwind Health Plus.

A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service. The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.\nIn-Network Copays:\nFor in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services. The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a copayment of around $50. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically around $100. In addition, for in-network preventive care services, there is typically no copayment.\nOut-of-Network Copays:\nFor out-of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in-network services.

This can be easily done by checking the provider directory on the Northwind Health Plus website. It is also important to remember that if you receive a service from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=12: By understanding and following these tips, you can be sure to get the most out of your Northwind Health Plus coverage and avoid unnecessary copayments.\nSplit Copay For Office Visits IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits\nNorthwind Health Plus offers a split copay for office visits in order to make healthcare more affordable for its members.

TMJ care is the diagnosis and management of disorders of the temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull. TMJ care can include diagnostics such as x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and other tests or treatments, including physical therapy, medications, and surgery.\nThe Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain TMJ treatments and services, such as treatment for bruxism, TMJ splint therapy, or orthodontic treatment. Additionally, any services or treatments that are deemed to be experimental or investigational are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan.\nEmployees with this plan should be aware that they may be subject to preauthorization requirements when seeking TMJ care. Preauthorization is a process in which a health insurance company reviews the medical necessity of a treatment or procedure prior to authorizing payment. This means that the employee must obtain approval from the insurance company before receiving the treatment or procedure.\nWhen seeking TMJ care, it is important for the employee to discuss their condition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can recommend specific treatments and services that are appropriate for the employee's condition and can help the employee understand if their treatment is covered by the Northwind Standard plan. It is also important for the employee to understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment. This includes any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be applicable.\nIn addition to discussing treatment options with their healthcare provider, employees should also be proactive in managing their TMJ condition. This includes avoiding activities that can exacerbate the problem, such as grinding teeth or chewing gum, and practicing relaxation techniques to reduce stress. Additionally, employees should practice good posture and avoid sleeping on their stomach to reduce strain on the jaw.

The first level of review involves a Registered Nurse (RN) or Medical Doctor (MD) evaluating the proposed course of treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary, then the case is approved and the member can proceed with the treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is not medically necessary, then the case is referred to the next level of review.\nAt the second level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Director, who is an MD or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). The Medical Director reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or not. If the Medical Director approves the case, then the member can proceed with the treatment. If the Medical Director does not approve the case, then the case is referred to the third level of review.\nAt the third and final level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Review Officer, who is an MD or DO. The Medical Review Officer reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or not. If the Medical Review Officer approves the case, then the member can proceed with the treatment. If the Medical Review Officer does not approve the case, then the member is not eligible to receive the treatment.\nThe Northwind Standard plan also offers several exceptions to the clinical review process. For example, certain types of medical services are exempt from clinical review and can be approved without going through the process. Additionally, certain time-sensitive services may be approved without going through the clinical review process if the member's health is in immediate danger.\nIt is important for members to understand the clinical review process and the exceptions that are available. Members should be aware that some medical services may require pre- authorization before they can be approved, and that the clinical review process may take some time. Additionally, members should keep in mind that the clinical review process is designed to ensure that medically necessary treatments are provided in a timely and cost- effective manner.\nTo help ensure that the clinical review process runs smoothly and quickly, members should provide accurate and detailed information about their medical needs when requesting treatment. This includes a complete list of their current medications, as well as all relevant medical history. Additionally, members should provide any necessary documentation that may be required, such as test results or lab reports. Finally, members should make sure that they understand the process and any exceptions that may apply.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=79: services that were provided out-of-country.
